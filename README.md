Tailwind CSS cannot be directly added to a library. However, styles from the application will automatically apply on library when the library is imported into an application.

## **Routes**

### **Adding a Route to an Existing Application**

```bash
npx nx g @nx/remix:route path-to-the-route/route-name
```

### **Adding a Loader to an Existing Route**

Run the following command:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/remix:loader path-to-the-route/route-name.extension
```

### **Adding an Action to an Existing Route**

Run the following command:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/remix:action path-to-the-route/route-name.extension
```

---

### **Understanding `path-to-the-route`**

The `path-to-the-route` refers to the **exact file path** from your current working directory to the location where the new route should be created or modified. This path must be relative to your project structure and should point directly to the folder or file where the route resides or is to be added.

For example:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/remix:route apps/app-name/app/routes/route-name
```

In this case:

- `apps/app-name/app/routes/` is the directory where your application's route files are located.
- `route-name` is the name of the new route being created.

This approach ensures that the new route is added to the appropriate location within your project. Always verify the folder structure to avoid misplacing routes.
